colorize
==========

Program Overview
--------------

With this program, you can add color to the standard output.
The simplest usage is to describe the command line as follow:

    $ colorize (Target string)

This command prints the entered characters in red.
For attaching any color, this command has four options.


1, -c and -r option
C option specifies the color.
Supported color is as follows:

    + black
    + red
    + green
    + yellow
    + blue
    + purple
    + cyan
    + under

R option specifies the details of the target string by regular expressions.
In other words, the following two commands to print the same color.

    $ colorize  (Target string)
    $ colorize -c red -r '^.*$' (Target string)

2, -s option
By using configuration file,
it is possible to configure more complex coloring rules as follows:

    $ colorize -s (coloring-scheme) (Text containing the target string )

The configuration file format is as follows:

    (coloring-rule name):
        (rule name):
            regular:"(Regular expression for the target string)"
            color:(color)

Regular expressions must be enclosed in ".
The default file path is '~/.colorize.yml'.


3, -f option
You can also load a differenet file as follows:

    $ colorize -f '(configuration file path)'-s (coloring-scheme) (Text containing the target string )


You can use the standard input to the input of the target string.

    $ tail -f (somefiles) | colorize -s (coloring-scheme)



How to install
--------------

$ colorize -f '~/file/test_colorize.yml' -s errorlog "Where is error"

    rule2:
        regular:"\[emerg\]"
        color:green

        regular:"[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*"
        color:blue
    rule2:
        regular:"[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*\.[0-9]*"
